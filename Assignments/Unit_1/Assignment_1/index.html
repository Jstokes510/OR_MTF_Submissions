<p>I am looking forward to getting to know more about how websites and coding works to use it in my organization and in my own life. I look forward to be able to pass on the knowledge to others in my communities. By the time the fellowship ends I hope to have enough knowledge to start and build on my own. Learning this information isn't something that is not easily accessible in our communities. I also hope to use the fellowship knowledge in my art and to start my own business.</p>
